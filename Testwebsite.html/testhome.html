                <h3>So what is photography?</h3>
                <p>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.</p>
                <p>Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.

            <h4>What is a photo gallery you ask?</h4>
            <p>It is a gallery, either in a building or on the internet, where photographs are on display.The photo gallery serves as a marketing tool to get visitors to focus on your photos. It elevates your brand status and offers a high-quality experience. Yet, most photographers overlook optimizing their photo gallery to fit their specific needs. </p>
